My firts functional app with clean architecture and BLoC as state Management.

## Packages used:

- retrofit: is a source code generator package that uses Dio as an http client to generate the proper methods we need to deal with REST APIs based on abstraction, it’s inspired by the Android Retrofit.
- floor: is a typesafe, reactive, lightweight source code generator package that uses the sqlite to store its data locally, it’s again inspired by Android Room.
- flutter_bloc: a flutter state management (You can still use any kind of state management you prefer to work with such as provider).
- equatable: a flutter package that makes comparing dart objects by equality is much easier.
- get_it: a service locator (also dependency injector).
- flutter_hooks: hooks inspired by React Hooks.
- lint: a flutter package that helps you write clean code which follows the Dart’s Style Guidelines, (explained more later).

That is a original project by [@devmuaz](https://github.com/devmuaz), i made the migration to null safety and i plan implement another functionalities.
